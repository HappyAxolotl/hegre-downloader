# hegre downloader
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Downloader and metadata extractor for `hegre.com`, written in python. This tool can only download content if you provide account details with a valid subsription.

**Disclaimer**: This is my first real python project, so there's probably a lot of room for improvements. Also it is mainly developed for my personal purpose of downloading videos.

## ü™õ Setup
- Make sure that you have git and python >= 3.10 installed
- Clone this repository
- Create a copy of `.env.dist` and name it `.env`
- Fill in your hegre.com account credentials in `.env`
- Optional: Create a virtual environment:
```sh
# setup venv
python3 -m venv --upgrade-deps .venv

# switch to venv 
# Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows (powershell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

## üìñ Usage as library
*coming soon*

## üë∑ Development
Complete the setup steps above. After that, install development dependencies and the pre-commit hook for the formatter:
```sh
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

## üí° Ideas
- Rewrite download status display in downloader:
  - Separate progress bar for each task i.e. show progress of subtasks such as trailer, screengrabs and subtitle download
  - Show filesize while downloading
- Custom filenames with format strings
- Separation between resolution of galleries (`px`) and movies (`p`) (`-r` flag)
- Subtitle files should match the schema `{movie_name}.{language_code}.ext`
- More robustness on errors (e.g. HTTP 404)
- Exit gracefully on SIGINT (`Ctrl+C`)
- Load configration via dynaconf (what should be a parameter, what should be loaded via file (only secrets?))
- Logout (end session)
- Documentation
- Unit testing
